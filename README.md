### **About Me**
My journey into coding began at university when I joined the robotics club. I discovered the power of C and C++ as I brought robots to life through code. Even in a non-software role, I applied programming to automate data extraction and chart generation in Excelâ€”turning repetitive work into single-click solutions.

These experiences cemented my passion for using code as a tool to solve real problems and create smarter, more efficient systems.
