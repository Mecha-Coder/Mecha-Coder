### **🙋🏼 About Me**
I’m Jason, a Mechanical Engineer with hands-on experience in manufacturing and a strong passion for software-driven automation. My interest in coding began during university through the robotics club, where I built and programmed combat robots using C and C++. Later, while working as a Manufacturing Engineer, I applied programming to automate data extraction and visualization tasks in Excel— reducing manual work.

After completing the Core Program at [42 Kuala Lumpur](https://www.42network.org/campus/42-kuala-lumpur/), I’ve deepened my foundation in computer science and software development. I’m now focused on creating intelligent systems where hardware and software integrate seamlessly to improve efficiency and solve real-world problems.
